	<h2>Spring Boot with Spring MVC and REST controllers</h2>
	<p>Inside the project there is a application.springboot.web package	containing these classes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>SpringBootLibertyApplication</code>: The entry point for the SpringBoot application.</li>
		<li><code>LibertyMVController</code>: A Spring MVC endpoint which you can access at <a href="springbootmvc">/springbootmvc</a></li>
		<li><code>LibertyRESTController</code>: A Spring REST endpoint which you can access at <a href="springbootrest">/springbootrest</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is also a test class named <code>it.springboot.web.HelloControllerTest</code> that will test the Spring MVC endpoint to ensure it is working.</p>
